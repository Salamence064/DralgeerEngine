// gravity based enemies (note none of them are affected by their own gravity swaps)
gravits
    - A gravit is a basic gravity manipulation enemy.
    - It can only do it in one direction and for a little bit of time before it has to rest.
    - They cannot damage you much on their own, but when paired with flying enemies can be quite tricky to deal with.
gravitors
    - A gravitor could be closer to a boss or a higher room enemy (or maybe modified to make it strong enough to be a boss)
    - It would be able to switch gravity in any direction and would have rocks that it can throw in that will damage the player (also affected by the gravity swaps)
    - It could also have some type of melee weapon or a stone arm that it could use to attack if the player gets close
